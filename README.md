- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheOneTrueNiz
- 👀 I’m interested in Ai, Machine Learning, and of course Robots
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can as quickly as I can about as many varied subjects as I can. But I'm also a freakin slacker so.. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Ai stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Uhh here, on Git would probably be a great start. Just sayin.. 
- 😄 Pronouns: According to the Collins Dictionary, 'A pronoun is a word that you use to refer to someone or something when you do not need to use a noun, often because the person or thing has been mentioned earlier. Examples are 'it', 'she', 'something', and 'myself'.'
- ⚡ Fun fact: I generally have no Idea what I'm doing. But I am sort of a Genuis, and I've found that in my experience any appropriate amount of flailing inevitably leads to forward momentum.
